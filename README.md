# an-adventage-game
emmm，其实吧，这是我从一个高星计算机教程里面copy来的一个库，本质上来说当我学完C#后应该就能完成这个游戏，但是目前想开摆，总之先扔仓库里，哪天想起来再完善

我大概看了一下，这个游戏是个RPG游戏，应该会包含一些简单的战斗系统以及任务系统，同时具有武器系统以及升级系统，挺简陋的，如果我之后想起来的话，可能会添加一些诸如魔法，护甲，天气之类的设定，
总之让时间来见证一切吧。没准学成之后我还会写个剧情再绑几个模型真正意义上的做成一个完整的游戏呢。那谁又知道呢，不是吗。



Well, actually, this is a library that I copied from a high-star computer tutorial. In essence, when I finish learning C#, I should be able to complete this game. 
However, for now, I just want to put it in the repository and come back to it whenever I remember.
I have a rough idea of what this game will be like. It seems to be an RPG game, which means it will probably have some basic combat system and quest system. It 
will also have weapon and leveling systems. It's quite simple, but if I remember later, I might add some features like magic, armor, weather, etc.
In short, let time witness everything. Maybe after I learn enough, I'll even write a storyline and attach some models to make it a complete game in the true sense. Who knows? Right?
